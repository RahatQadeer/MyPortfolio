# 🚀 Rahat Qadeer – Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal developer portfolio built using **React.js**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**. It showcases my skills, projects, services, and contact information. The website is fully responsive, fast, and includes interactive UI elements and smooth scrolling. The contact form is integrated with **EmailJS**, which sends form submissions directly to my Gmail.
